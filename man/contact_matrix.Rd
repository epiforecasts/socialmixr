\arguments{
\item{survey}{a \code{\link[=survey]{survey()}} object}

\item{countries}{limit to one or more countries; if not given, will use all countries in the survey; these can be given as country names or 2-letter (ISO Alpha-2) country codes}

\item{survey.pop}{survey population -- either a data frame with columns 'lower.age.limit' and 'population', or a character vector giving the name(s) of a country or countries from the list that can be obtained via \code{wpp_countries}; if not given, will use the country populations from the chosen countries, or all countries in the survey if \code{countries} is not given}

\item{age.limits}{lower limits of the age groups over which to construct the matrix}

\item{filter}{any filters to apply to the data, given as list of the form (column=filter_value) - only contacts that have 'filter_value' in 'column' will be considered. If multiple filters are given, they are all applied independently and in the sequence given.}

\item{n}{deprecated; number of bootstrap samples to generate}

\item{bootstrap}{deprecated; whether to bootstrap contact matrices}

\item{counts}{whether to return counts (instead of means)}

\item{symmetric}{whether to make matrix symmetric, such that c_{ij}N_i = c{ji}N_j.}

\item{split}{whether to split the number of contacts and assortativity}

\item{sample.participants}{whether to sample participants randomly (with replacement); done multiple times this can be used to assess uncertainty in the generated contact matrices. See the \link{contact_matrix_multi} for how to do this..}

\item{estimated.participant.age}{if set to "mean" (default), people whose ages are given as a range (in columns named "..._est_min" and "..._est_max") but not exactly (in a column named "..._exact") will have their age set to the mid-point of the range; if set to "sample", the age will be sampled from the range; if set to "missing", age ranges will be treated as missing}

\item{estimated.contact.age}{if set to "mean" (default), contacts whose ages are given as a range (in columns named "..._est_min" and "..._est_max") but not exactly (in a column named "..._exact") will have their age set to the mid-point of the range; if set to "sample", the age will be sampled from the range; if set to "missing", age ranges will be treated as missing}

\item{missing.participant.age}{if set to "remove" (default), participants without age information are removed; if set to "keep", participants with missing age are kept and treated as a separate age group}

\item{missing.contact.age}{if set to "remove" (default), participants that have contacts without age information are removed; if set to "sample", contacts without age information are sampled from all the contacts of participants of the same age group; if set to "keep", contacts with missing age are kept and treated as a separate age group; if set to "ignore", contact with missing age are ignored in the contact analysis}

\item{weights}{column names(s) of the participant data of the \code{\link[=survey]{survey()}} object with user-specified weights (default = empty vector)}

\item{weigh.dayofweek}{whether to weigh social contacts data by the day of the week (weight (5/7 / N_week / N) for weekdays and (2/7 / N_weekend / N) for weekends)}

\item{weigh.age}{whether to weigh social contacts data by the age of the participants (vs. the populations' age distribution)}

\item{weight.threshold}{threshold value for the standardized weights before running an additional standardisation (default 'NA' = no cutoff)}

\item{sample.all.age.groups}{what to do if bootstrapping fails to sample participants from one or more age groups; if FALSE (default), corresponding rows will be set to NA, if TRUE the sample will be discarded and a new one taken instead}

\item{return.part.weights}{boolean to return the participant weights}

\item{return.demography}{boolean to explicitly return demography data that corresponds to the survey data (default 'NA' = if demography data is requested by other function parameters)}

\item{per.capita}{wheter to return a matrix with contact rates per capita (default is FALSE and not possible if 'counts=TRUE' or 'split=TRUE')}

\item{...}{further arguments to pass to \code{\link[=get_survey]{get_survey()}}, \code{\link[=check]{check()}} and \code{\link[=pop_age]{pop_age()}} (especially column names)}
