#' Process ages in survey data
#'
#' @description
#' This function deals with age ranges and missing data in survey data. It
#'   adjusts the age group breaks to the lower and upper ages in the survey,
#'   and processes contact age ranges and drops missing values. We suggest you
#'   impute missing values prior to using `survey_process_ages`, using
#'   [survey_impute_ages()].
#'
#' @param survey a [survey()] object
#' @param age_limits lower limits of the age groups over which to construct
#'   the matrix. Defaults to NULL. If NULL, it will construct age limits based
#'   upon age ranges in participants data of the survey.
#' @param missing_participant_age if set to "remove" (default), participants
#'   without age information are removed; if set to "keep", participants with
#'   missing age are kept and treated as a separate age group
#' @param missing_contact_age if set to "remove" (default), participants that
#'   have contacts without age information are removed; if set to "sample",
#'   contacts without age information are sampled from all the contacts of
#'   participants of the same age group; if set to "keep", contacts with missing
#'   age are kept and treated as a separate age group; if set to "ignore",
#'   contact with missing age are ignored in the contact analysis
#' @returns
#' The survey object with processed age data.
