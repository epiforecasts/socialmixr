# socialmixr 0.1.9

## Major & breaking changes

* `error` argument has been removed from `check()` and always return warnings. If you want to turn these warnings into errors, please have a look at `options(warn = 2)`
* `quiet` argument has been removed from `check()`, `cite()`, `contact_matrix()`, and `get_survey()`. If you want to silence diagnostic messages, you should use R idiomatic mechanisms, such as `suppressMessages()`
* new `matrix_plot()` function to plot contact matrix

## Minor changes

to wpp2017 package
